This is a basic frontpage for the website. And it is completely resposive.
I was creating a website for a computer retail shop named 'RB Tech & Games' in Hafeez Center as i work with them and this is the start of it.
Created 3 pages which are the home page,product page and login page.

Instructions : 
-Click on 'HOME' or 'RB Tech & Games' on navbar to go to Home page which is the default page.
-Click on 'PRODUCTS' on navbar to go to products section.
-Click on 'Login' button to go to the login page.

Description : 

//HomePage :
The homepage consists of 2 sections. First section basically gives us the motto of the shop along with 2 buttons which could be set to anything. 
The second section displays us the 'Builds' section which is basically a gallery of the computer parts and pc's build over there at the shop and photos taken from instagram.

//ProductsPage : 
The products page shows us the products that are available and if we hover on it and click on info button on top right of product card we can see the description of it.
Also if we click on the card we can see the price and a button to add to cart.

//LoginPage : 
It is a simple login page designed for customers to login. You can login using credentials
